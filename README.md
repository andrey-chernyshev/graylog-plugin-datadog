# GraylogPluginDatadog Plugin for Graylog (fork)

Few improvements over the [original plugin version](https://github.com/underdogio/graylog-plugin-datadog):

* DataDog Tags can include message field values (e.g. ${field_name}:{$value})
* Define field set to be included with message details    
* Use field value as aggregation key
